Returns the preferred hypothesis when testing for partial cointegration
}
\description{Returns the preferred hypothesis when testing for partial cointegration}
\usage{
which.hypothesis.pcitest(AT)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{AT}{
An object of class \code{"pcitest"} that has been returned by a 
previous call to \code{\link{test.pci}}.
}
}
\details{
Based upon the critical value \code{alpha} that was given in the
call to \code{test.pci} and the p-value that was computed, 
determines which hypothesis best fits the data.  
}
\value{
If a non-robust fit was used, then one of the following values is returned:
\item{\code{"PCI"}}{Partially cointegrated.  Both the random walk hypothesis
  and the AR(1) hypothesis were rejected.}
\item{\code{"RW"}}{Random walk.}
\item{\code{"AR1"}}{Autoregressive of order one.}

If a robust fit was used, then one of the following values is returned:
\item{\code{"RPCI"}}{Partially cointegrated.  Both the random walk hypothesis
  and the AR(1) hypothesis were rejected.}
\item{\code{"RRW"}}{Random walk.}
\item{\code{"RAR1"}}{Autoregressive of order one.}

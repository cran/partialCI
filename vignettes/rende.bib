@misc{Bikker.2012,
 abstract = {This paper discusses the implications of mean reversion in stock prices for long-term investors such as pension funds. We start with a general definition of a mean-reverting price process and explain how mean reversion in stock prices is related to mean reversion in stock returns. Subsequently, we show that mean reversion makes stocks less risky for investors with long investment horizons. Next, we consider a mean-variance efficient investor and show how mean reversion in stock prices affects such an investor's optimal portfolio weights. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for the investment decisions of long-term investors},

 abstract = {This survey reviews the growing literature on pairs trading frameworks, i.e., relative-value arbitrage strategies involving two or more securities. The available research is categorized into five groups: The distance approach uses nonparametric distance metrics to identify pairs trading opportunities. The cointegration approach relies on formal cointegration testing to unveil stationary spread time series. The time series approach focuses on finding optimal trading rules for mean-reverting spreads. The stochastic control approach aims at identifying optimal portfolio holdings in the legs of a pairs trade relative to other available securities. The category {\dq}other approaches{\dq} contains further relevant pairs trading frameworks with only a limited set of supporting literature. Drawing from this large set of research consisting of more than 90 papers, an in-depth assessment of each approach is performed, ultimately revealing strengths and weaknesses relevant for further research and for implementation.},

@book{Tsay.2010,
 abstract = {This book provides a broad, mature, and systematic introduction to current financial econometric models and their applications to modeling and prediction of financial time series data. It utilizes real-world examples and real financial data throughout the book to apply the models and methods described. The author begins with basic characteristics of financial time series data before covering three main topics: Analysis and application of univariate financial time series; The return series of multiple assets; Bayesian inference in finance methods. Key features of the new edition include additional coverage of modern day topics such as arbitrage, pair trading, realized volatility, and credit risk modeling; a smooth transition from S-Plus to R; and expanded empirical financial data sets. The overall objective of the book is to provide some knowledge of financial time series, introduce some statistical tools useful for analyzing these series and gain experience in financial applications of various econometric methods.},
